"""
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, 
sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the libraryâ€™s sort function for this problem.

Can you do this in a single pass?

Example:
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Here's a starting point:

class Solution:
  def sortColors(self, nums):
    # Fill this in.

nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]
print("Before Sort: ")
print(nums)
# [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]

Solution().sortColors(nums)
print("After Sort: ")
print(nums)
# [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
"""
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        # Fill this in.
        # quick sort

        # anything on the left of low will be 0
        # anything on the right of high will be 2
        # mid is simply a pointer that transverses the whole array
        low = 0
        mid = 0
        high = len(nums) - 1
        while mid <= high:
            if nums[mid] == 2:
                nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
                # high pointer move to the left by one but mid pointer does not move
                # because alr at the end of arr
                high -= 1
            elif nums[mid] == 0:
                nums[mid], nums[low] = nums[low], nums[mid]
                # low pointer can move by one and the mid pointer can continue
                low += 1
                mid += 1
            else:
                # when nums[mid] == 1
                mid += 1

        return nums

nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]
print("Before Sort: ")
print(nums)
# [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1]

Solution().sortColors(nums)
print("After Sort: ")
print(nums)
# [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
